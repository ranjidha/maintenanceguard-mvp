# 📖 MaintenanceGuard — Setup Guide for Non-Technical Users

Welcome! This guide will walk you through running MaintenanceGuard on your computer step by step. No technical experience needed — just follow each step in order.

**Total setup time: about 15–20 minutes (most of it is waiting for downloads)**

---

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. A computer running **Windows 10/11** or **Mac**
2. A stable internet connection
3. An **Anthropic API Key** (instructions below on how to get one)

---

## STEP 1 — Get Your Anthropic API Key

This app uses AI (Claude) to read your invoices and give recommendations. You need a key to use it.

1. Go to **https://console.anthropic.com/**
2. Click **Sign Up** and create a free account
3. Once logged in, click **API Keys** in the left menu
4. Click **Create Key**, give it a name like "MaintenanceGuard"
5. **Copy the key** — it looks like `sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxx...`
6. Save it somewhere safe (like Notepad) — you'll need it in Step 4

> ⚠️ **Important:** Keep this key private. Don't share it with anyone or post it online.

## STEP 2 — Install Docker Desktop

Docker is a free program that runs the app on your computer without needing to install lots of separate software.

### On Windows:
1. Go to **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/**
2. Click **Download for Windows**
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installer
4. When it asks about WSL 2, click **OK** and let it install
5. Restart your computer when prompted
6. After restart, open **Docker Desktop** from your Start menu
7. Wait until you see a green **"Engine running"** status at the bottom left

### On Mac:
1. Go to **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/**
2. Click **Download for Mac** (choose Apple Chip if you have an M1/M2/M3 Mac, otherwise Intel)
3. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Docker to Applications
4. Open Docker from your Applications folder
5. Wait until you see a green **"Engine running"** status

> ✅ You'll know Docker is ready when you see a small whale icon in your taskbar/menu bar

---

## STEP 3 — Install Git

Git lets you download the app code from GitHub.

### On Windows:
1. Go to **https://git-scm.com/download/win**
2. The download starts automatically — open and run the installer
3. Click **Next** through all the options (defaults are fine)
4. Click **Install**, then **Finish**

### On Mac:
1. Open **Terminal** (search for it in Spotlight with Cmd+Space)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If not installed, a popup will appear — click **Install** and follow the steps

---

## STEP 4 — Download the App

Now you'll download the MaintenanceGuard code to your computer.

### On Windows:
1. Click the **Start menu** and search for **"Command Prompt"** — open it
2. Type these commands one at a time, pressing **Enter** after each:

```
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/maintenanceguard-mvp.git
cd maintenanceguard-mvp
```

> 📝 Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the actual GitHub username shared with you

### On Mac:
1. Open **Terminal** (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")
2. Type these commands one at a time, pressing **Enter** after each:

```
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/maintenanceguard-mvp.git
cd maintenanceguard-mvp
```

---

## STEP 5 — Add Your API Key

1. In the same Command Prompt / Terminal window, type:

**On Windows:**
```
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

**On Mac:**
```
cp .env.example .env
open -e .env
```

2. A text file will open. Find this line:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

3. Replace `your_anthropic_api_key_here` with the key you copied in Step 1. It should look like:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

4. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S on Windows, Cmd+S on Mac) and close it

---

## STEP 6 — Start the App

Make sure **Docker Desktop is running** (you should see the whale icon), then in your Command Prompt / Terminal type:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```

Press Enter and wait. You'll see lots of text scrolling — this is normal! It's downloading and setting everything up.

**The first time this takes about 5–10 minutes.** After that it starts in under 30 seconds.

When you see the cursor return and no more text is scrolling, it's ready.

---

## STEP 7 — Load Vehicle Data

This loads the Toyota maintenance schedule data into the app. Type this command:

**On Windows:**
```
docker exec -i maintenanceguard-db psql -U postgres -d maintenanceguard < toyota_oem_data.sql
```

**On Mac:**
```
docker exec -i maintenanceguard-db psql -U postgres -d maintenanceguard < toyota_oem_data.sql
```

Press Enter. It should complete quickly with no errors.

## STEP 8 — Open the App 🎉

Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and go to:

## 👉 http://localhost:3000

You should see the MaintenanceGuard dashboard!

## ❓ Common Problems & Solutions

### "Site can't be reached" or blank page
- Make sure Docker Desktop is open and shows "Engine running"
- Try running: `docker compose up -d`
- Wait 30 seconds and refresh the browser

### "This site can't be reached" at localhost:3000
- Check if containers are running: `docker compose ps`
- All three should show "Up" status
- If not, run: `docker compose up -d`

### App loads but shows no vehicles after you added them
- Open http://localhost:8000/api/vehicles in your browser
- If you see your vehicles listed there, try refreshing the main page
- If blank, run: `docker compose restart backend`

### Recommendations show "Failed to generate"
- Your API key might be wrong — double check your `.env` file
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign in the key

### Port already in use error
**Windows** — Open Command Prompt and run:
```
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <the number shown> /F
